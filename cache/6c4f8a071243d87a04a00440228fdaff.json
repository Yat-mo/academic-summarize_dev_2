The motivation stems from the computational challenges posed by the scaling of derivative tensors, which grow exponentially with the order of differentiation and dimensionality. Evaluating such tensors using traditional methods like backpropagation is inefficient due to excessive memory and computational requirements. Previous works have attempted to address the scaling problem by using randomization to reduce the computational cost in high-dimensional spaces and employing high-order auto-differentiation (AD) for univariate functions. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to handle both high-dimensional and high-order derivatives simultaneously. This paper introduces a framework to efficiently amortize the cost of computing these derivative tensors, making it possible to address both the dimensionality and order of derivatives at the same time.\n\nThe authors propose a method where high-order automatic differentiation (AD) is combined with randomization techniques, specifically for multivariate functions. By properly constructing input tangents to univariate high-order AD, they demonstrate how to perform the contraction of derivative tensors of arbitrary order. This approach significantly reduces both computational and memory costs. The method is particularly relevant for **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, which frequently involve solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). The contributions include a thorough analysis of how to randomize and efficiently evaluate differential operators, a generalization of previous methods like Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD) and Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE), and experimental validation that shows substantial improvements in speed and memory usage.\n\n### Main Findings\n\nThe **Stochastic Taylor Derivative Estimator (STDE)** offers several key advantages and findings:\n1. **High Efficiency in PINNs**: When applied to PINNs, STDE achieves a **1000× speed-up** and **30× memory reduction** over traditional methods, especially when solving large-scale PDEs. This allows solving 1-million-dimensional PDEs on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU in just 8 minutes, demonstrating the scalability and power of STDE for high-dimensional problems.\n2. **Scalable Approach**: The methodology applies to **arbitrary differential operators** of any order, efficiently handling both the scaling of dimensionality ($d$) and derivative order ($k$) by combining Taylor mode AD with randomization. This results in a **polynomial scaling** of both memory and computation, eliminating the exponential scaling seen in traditional methods.\n3. **Improvement Over Previous Methods**: The STDE approach significantly outperforms other methods like SDGD (Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent), which previously addressed the curse of dimensionality in high-order derivatives. STDE’s use of Taylor mode AD for contraction of derivative tensors ensures it can handle complex multi-index differential operators that SDGD and HTE cannot.\n\nThe methodology itself is rooted in **randomization techniques** for reducing complexity, where differential operators are treated as linear combinations of derivative terms. Through stochastic sampling of the input space, it is possible to approximate the operator without explicitly computing the full derivative tensor, maintaining efficiency and accuracy.\n\n### Value and Applications\n\nThe **theoretical significance** of STDE lies in its **unification of randomization** and **high-order AD** techniques, providing a scalable framework to address the computational bottlenecks associated with high-dimensional and high-order derivatives. This innovation opens doors to solving large-scale PDEs, such as those encountered in **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, where both the **order of differentiation** and the **dimension of the input space** can be prohibitively large. The authors prove that their approach is not only applicable to second-order differential operators but can also extend to higher-order operators, making it a general solution to a wide range of problems.\n\n**Practical applications** of this work are extensive. In the realm of **numerical PDE solvers**, STDE can be applied to solve complex systems in physics, engineering, and finance that are modeled by high-dimensional PDEs. The efficiency of the method allows for the rapid solution of problems such as the **Schrödinger equation**, **Black-Scholes equations**, and various **semilinear parabolic PDEs**. Furthermore, it enhances the **training** of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, which are critical in tasks such as inverse design and simulation of physical systems.\n\nThe **future research directions** could focus on:\n- **Variance reduction techniques**: Exploring methods to further minimize the variance in randomized estimators could lead to more accurate and stable solutions.\n- **Higher-order tensor contractions**: Extending the method to more complex tensor contractions beyond the fourth order.\n- **Generalized AD frameworks**: Investigating the application of STDE in broader **machine learning** and **neural network optimization** contexts, especially where high-order derivatives are essential.\n\nIn conclusion, STDE represents a significant step forward in optimizing neural networks involving complex differential operators, with the potential to solve a broad class of high-dimensional scientific problems."
